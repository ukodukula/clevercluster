CleverCluster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ukodukula/clevercluster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ukodukula/clevercluster)
=============

The following is a collection of machine learning algorithms that I have implemented for instructional purposes. Please feel free to fork this repo and contribute!

I hope the visual demonstrations motivate and excite people about AI and Machine Learning.

This repo uses Maven to manage build and dependencies. In order to install and run a viewable demo first run a clean install command using maven, and then execute the JAR executable that would be placed in the target directory.

```
$ mvn clean install
$ java -jar target/clevercluster-#.#.#.jar
```

Cheers!
Uday Kodukula
